Gathering some material for a Python class aimed at first year undergraduate mathematicians at Southampton. To be covered in ten hours of labs.

To build these notes you will need

* python (3.3+)
* ipython (3+)
* ipython-notebook or jupyter (the notes recommend jupyter, but that's for forwards compatibility: it should work on ipython-notebook 3+)
* scipy stack (scipy, sympy, numpy, matplotlib)
* latex
* nose
* watermark line magic (see https://github.com/rasbt/watermark)
* memory profiler line magic (see https://pypi.python.org/pypi/memory_profiler)
